  <h1>python-based gui for the arduino temperature chamber</h1>
  <h2>temperature chamber project in short</h2>
  <p>the temperature chamber is a complete system for benchmark testing and stress-testing electronic boards in a controlled thermal environment. it combines accessible hardware, advanced firmware, and a python-based desktop application to achieve precise temperature control, test execution, and real-time monitoring. the system is designed to standardize thermal testing while prioritizing accessibility and replicability with cost-effective, off-the-shelf components.</p>

  <h2>desktop application</h2>
  <p>the python-based desktop application, which is the part of the whole project that i developed, provides an intuitive interface to interact with the chamber. however, working with a gui is not just about the interface itself. its high performance depends entirely on what's happening under the hood, where the most essential parts of the design reside.<br/>there are at least two arduino boards involved in the temperature chamber: the control board on the outside of the chamber, and at least one test board inside it. the gui needs to send commands to the control board and receive real-time data from it for display and analysis. in terms of the test board(s), it is responsible for uploading the test sketches onto them (using cli commands) as well as continuously receiving and logging their output. the logic i developed for direct test output processing accounts for both deterministic and non-deterministic testing.</p>

  <h2>some of the more exciting technical aspects of gui development</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>THREADING _____ in pyqt5, making serial communication with the arduino boards smooth and reliable, while using two or more serial ports (also a wifi port), requires well-designed threading and port management to improve the gui's performance, and prevent port access conflicts and blocking. this also implies sub-threading and temporary port-killing as well as their subsequent resuscitation.</li>
    <li>COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL _____ developing a communication protocol with a finite state machine is essential to securing a reliable exchange between the gui and the control board. its cornerstone elements are 'handshake' and 'ping.' handshake checks if the serial communication is working, and it transmits some basic data between the gui and the control board, such as current timestamp for accurate operation synchronization. ping is sent to the board continuously at an interval of 500 milliseconds, and its role is twofold. firstly, it retrieves all current info on, for example, machine state, temperature inside the chamber, test queue and current test sequence, for precise monitoring and display updates. its second purpose is to make sure the serial communication is working at all times: if ping does not come back from the control board for a specific time, the user gets an alert.<br/>in the case of the test board(s), the situation is simpler, as there is no need for timestamp synchronization or other data updates. the only purpose of a communication protocol here is to check if the serial communication is not broken. all other deviancies are handled differently: a failure in sketch compilation and upload will immediately raise errors, while incorrect test output transmission, as a part of the test itself, gets logged and visually signaled in the gui.</li>
    <li>TEST PROGRESS BARS _____ calculating precise progress bar display for a dyi temperature chamber is tricky, as the cooling and heating times vary significantly, because of a barely controllable cooling system, so the total running time can only be a rough estimate. the test sequence progess bar, though, is very accurate, because it is re-rendered according to the current information coming from the control board through ping.</li>
    <li>EDGE-CASE ERROR HANDLING _____ when working with real-time hardware communication, especially over serial ports, edge cases are inevitable. to keep the gui stable, i implemented dedicated handling for unexpected disconnections, timeouts, corrupted data, and port access conflicts. the system identifies unusual behaviors early and responds with targeted alerts or safe fallback states to prevent cascading failures or user confusion. in some cases, automatic reconnection routines are triggered to reestablish communication without user intervention.</li>
    <li>USING CLI COMMANDS _____ cli commands are used primarily for compiling and uploading test sketches to the test board(s). the gui wraps these commands in subprocesses, handles their outputs in real time, and logs both successes and failures. any compilation errors or upload issues are captured, parsed, and clearly displayed in the gui. the system also supports queueing multiple uploads and provides visual feedback on the status of each task.</li>
